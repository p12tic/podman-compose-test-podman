Description: tool to manage containers and pods
 Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes
 mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers.
 .
 At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:
  * Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker
    images.
  * Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources
    (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or
    Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and
    other storage backends.
  * Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an
    image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and
    restoring (via CRIU), and removal.
  * Full management of container networking, using Netavark.
  * Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed
    together.
  * Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated
    privileges.
  * Resource isolation of containers and pods.
  * Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run
    containers locally and on remote systems.
  * No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at
    idle.
  * Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an
    improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.
  * Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by podman
    machine.
 .
 Podman is a daemon-less alternative to Docker.

 Podman is a daemon-less alternative to Docker.
 .
 This package provides a smaller executable, a local client to interact with a
 Podman backend node through a RESTful API tunneled through an SSH connection.
